# Witboost Starter Kit Access Request Template

## Overview

Use the templates present on this repository to configure Access Control Request forms on your Witboost instance. It includes both a grant and a revoke template, used to ask the appropriate information to users requesting access to consumables through the Marketplaces.

### What's an Access Request Template?

An Access Request Template is a standard Witboost template like the ones that are used to create Data Products and Components, but it has the purpose of customizing the access request form for Witboost components through the Marketplace.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p3_tech/p4_access_control/accessRequestTemplate).

### Usage

As default, the templates contained on this repository are configured to be automatically registered as part of your Witboost installation. In the case this behaviour was disabled or you can't see them, please follow the steps explained on the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p3_tech/p4_access_control/accessRequestTemplate#how-it-works) to register them.
